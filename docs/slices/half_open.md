The “half-open” interval slicing convention (where `arr[3:7]` includes index 3 and excludes 7) is widely adopted in programming (Python, Go, Java, etc.) for several compelling reasons:

---

### 1. **Length Calculation is Simple and Intuitive**

With `arr[start:end]`, the length is always `end - start`.

- Example: `arr[3:7]` yields 4 elements (indices 3, 4, 5, 6), because `7 - 3 = 4`.
- This means you never have to adjust for “off-by-one” errors when calculating sizes.

---

### 2. **Easy to Chain Slices**

You can split and combine slices seamlessly:

```go
a := arr[0:3]
b := arr[3:7]
c := arr[7:len(arr)]
// a + b + c == arr
```
No overlap, no gaps.

---

### 3. **Zero-based Indexing Compatibility**

It matches how ranges and loops work:

```go
for i := 3; i < 7; i++ {
    // accesses arr[i]
}
```
The loop uses `< end`, and the slice does the same—consistent and less error-prone.

---

### 4. **Empty Slices are Natural**

When `start == end`, the slice is empty. For example, `arr[5:5]` produces an empty slice, which is logical.

---

### 5. **Concatenating Adjacent Slices Covers the Whole Array**

For any `k`, `arr[0:k]` and `arr[k:n]` together cover the whole array without overlap.

---

### 6. **Mathematical Consistency**

In mathematics, intervals are often expressed as `[a, b)` (includes `a`, excludes `b`). This convention translates well to programming.

---

#### **Conclusion**

The “start inclusive, end exclusive” slicing convention makes code easier to read, avoids common pitfalls (off-by-one errors), and ensures consistency across language constructs. That’s why it’s considered beneficial and is the default in many languages.

### **How closed boundaries would look like**

## 1. **Length Calculation Becomes Awkward**

- If both ends are included, the length would be `end - start + 1`.
- Example: `arr[3:7]` gives 5 elements (indices 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).
- You now have to remember to add `+1` every time you want to know the slice’s length.

---

## 2. **Chaining Slices is Error-Prone**

- To split the array into non-overlapping chunks, you’d need to do:

```go
a := arr[0:3]    // 0,1,2,3
b := arr[4:7]    // 4,5,6,7
```
- Notice you must increment the start index for the next slice (`start = prev_end + 1`). This is less intuitive and more prone to off-by-one mistakes.

---

## 3. **Loop Boundaries are Inconsistent**

- Typical for-loops use `<` as the condition: `for i := 3; i < 7; i++`
- But with inclusive end, you’d need `for i := 3; i <= 7; i++`
- This breaks the symmetry between loop ranges and slice notation.

---

## 4. **Empty Slices Are Less Natural**

- With inclusive ends, `arr[5:5]` would yield a single element (`[arr[5]]`), not an empty slice.
- To get an empty slice, you’d use something like `arr[5:4]`, which is unintuitive.

---

## 5. **Concatenating Adjacent Slices Can Overlap or Miss Elements**

- With inclusive ends, you must manually adjust indices to avoid overlap or gaps when splitting and joining slices.

---

## 6. **Mathematical Disagreement**

- In mathematics, intervals are typically `[a, b)` or `(a, b]`, not `[a, b]` for slicing. Using `[a, b]` in code would break this parallel.

### **Summary Table**

| Convention        | Length Formula      | Empty Slice | Loop Compatibility | Chaining Slices | Mathematical Consistency |
|-------------------|--------------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| `[start, end)`    | `end - start`      | Yes         | Yes (`< end`)      | Easy            | Yes                     |
| `[start, end]`    | `end - start + 1`  | No          | No (`<= end`)      | Error-prone     | No                      |

---

**Including the end index makes array slicing less consistent, more error-prone, and harder to reason about. That’s why most languages and mathematical conventions favor the half-open interval `[start, end)`.**
